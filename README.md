# portfolio
This is a portfolio I made for myself using React and CSS. Here I host all of the projects I have completed. I have set up an array of projects where I can easily add new projects while writing a minimal amount of extra code. This projects array is fed into a dummy modal component which renders the appropriate details/site links of each project.
